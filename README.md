# 📘 Loan Approval Prediction with Machine Learning

## 🧠 Project Overview  
This notebook explores how machine learning can assist loan approval decisions by analyzing applicant features such as income, credit history, and property type. The goal is to build interpretable and accurate models that support fair and effective lending practices.

## 🛠️ Workflow Steps
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categoricals, scaling features  
- Model training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC, KNN  
- Evaluation: confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, probability threshold analysis  
- Final recommendation: Random Forest selected for balance of performance and interpretability
